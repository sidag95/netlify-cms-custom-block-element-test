# Test Webhooks

You can test webhooks to verify payloads or check if your webhook integration is working properly. Test events get triggered on a transaction done in test mode. As the payload structure remains the same in the live and test modes, you can confidently rely on your stage testing.

You can test webhooks:

* [Using request interceptor tools](https://razorpay.com/docs/webhooks/test/#using-request-interceptor-tools).
* [On an application running on localhost](https://razorpay.com/docs/webhooks/test/#on-an-application-running-on-localhost).
* [On an application running on your staging environment](https://razorpay.com/docs/webhooks/test/#on-an-application-running-on-your-staging-environment).

## Using Request Interceptor Tools

There are many free webhook testing tools available online. A simple Google search for *test webhooks online* returns multiple sites that you can use to test webhooks. One such example is [requestbin.com](https://requestbin.com/). Follow these steps to test webhooks:

1. Open [requestbin.com](https://requestbin.com/).
2. Click **Create Request Bin** and log in using Google or GitHub to create a private bin. Alternatively, you can opt for a public bin.
3. Click **Create Request Bin** and log in using Google or GitHub to create a private bin. Alternatively, you can opt for a public bin.
4. Proceed to set up webhooks, but with the following changes:

   1. Ensure you are using Test Mode on the Dashboard.
   2. Paste the endpoint you copied in the previous step, in the **Website URL** field.

If you have enabled the appropriate webhook event during setup, you will receive the corresponding webhook payload on your requestbin.com site.
